# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢  

This repository contains my work on the famous Kaggle Titanic competition.  
The goal is to predict passenger survival using machine learning and deep learning models.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- **data/**: raw and processed datasets  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks (EDA, feature engineering, ML/DL models)  
- **src/**: modular Python scripts for data and modeling  
- **outputs/**: plots, metrics, and submission files  

## ⚙️ Models Tried
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)
- Deep Neural Network (Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster.git
   cd Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaste
   pip install 
2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open and run notebooks in Jupyter

## 📊 Results

<!-- Baseline Logistic Regression: ~78% accuracy
Best Model (XGBoost): ~82% accuracy -->

## 📌 Notes
This project is mainly for learning and sharing my journey in ML/DL/AI.
